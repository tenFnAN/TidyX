## Problem Statement

The FBL (fantasy baseball league) wants to predict which pitches are thrown. 
Traditionally it was labeled by a human sitting in the stands.
They want to productionalize it to give the classifications faster. 

They hired us...

## Load Data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

bp <- here::here("TidyTuesday_Explained/056-MLB_pitch_classification_4")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      root.dir = bp)

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(tidyverse)
    library(xgboost)
    library(caret)
    library(doParallel)
  })
})


```

```{r load-data-and-clean}

## see Episode 53 - bit.ly/TidyX_Ep53 - for the background on this cleanup

# train
set1 <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_21_to_2016_04_23_pitch.rds"))
set2 <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_24_to_2016_04_26_pitch.rds"))
train <- bind_rows(set1, set2)

#test
test <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_27_to_2016_04_30_pitch.rds"))

names(train)


#### Cleaning data based on EDA ----------------------------------------------

# for more details on decisions, Check out TidyX 53
train_cleaned <- train %>%
  filter(!pitch_type %in% c("KN", "IN", "PO", "EP", "FO"),
         !is.na(pitch_type)) %>%
  select(pitch_type, start_speed, end_speed, pfx_x, pfx_z, px, pz, x0, z0, vx0, vz0)

test_cleaned <- test %>%
  filter(!pitch_type %in% c("KN", "IN", "PO", "EP", "FO", "SC"),
         !is.na(pitch_type)) %>%
  select(pitch_type, start_speed, end_speed, pfx_x, pfx_z, px, pz, x0, z0, vx0, vz0)

train_cleaned$pitch_type <- factor(train_cleaned$pitch_type, level = unique(train_cleaned$pitch_type))

test_cleaned$pitch_type <- factor(test_cleaned$pitch_type, level = levels(train_cleaned$pitch_type))


```


## format data

```{r additional-processing}

## convert pitch type to numeric
train_cleaned$pitch_type_num <- as.numeric(train_cleaned$pitch_type) - 1
test_cleaned$pitch_type_num <- as.numeric(test_cleaned$pitch_type) - 1

train_cleaned %>% 
  distinct(pitch_type,pitch_type_num)

## create training and test matrices
train_x <- data.matrix(train_cleaned %>% select(-pitch_type, -pitch_type_num))
train_y <- train_cleaned %>% pull(pitch_type_num)

test_x <- data.matrix(test_cleaned %>% select(-pitch_type, -pitch_type_num))
test_y <- test_cleaned %>% pull(pitch_type_num)

```

```{r}

## store data in special XGBoost matrix
train_xgb_matrix <- xgb.DMatrix(data = train_x, label = train_y)
test_xgb_matrix <- xgb.DMatrix(data = test_x, label = test_y)

```

## xgboost

#### Parameter searching

```{r xgboost}

## train model
number_pitches <- length(unique(train_cleaned$pitch_type))

model_parameters <- list(
  "eval_metric" = "mlogloss",
  "num_class"   = number_pitches,
  "objective"   = "multi:softprob"
  )

wl <- list(train = train_xgb_matrix, test = test_xgb_matrix)

pitch_xgb_train <- xgb.train(data = train_xgb_matrix,
                     max.depth = 3,
                     nrounds = 1000,
                     watchlist = wl,
                     nthreads = 3,
                     early_stopping_rounds = 10,
                     params = model_parameters)

pitch_xgb_train

```

### evaluation

```{r}
## Training & test error plot
log_loss_df <- data.frame(pitch_xgb_train$evaluation_log)
plot(log_loss_df$iter, log_loss_df$train_mlogloss, col = 'blue')
lines(log_loss_df$iter, log_loss_df$test_mlogloss, col = "red")

# Find the iteration that minimized log loss
min(log_loss_df$test_mlogloss)

log_loss_df[which.min(log_loss_df$test_mlogloss),]

best_itr <- log_loss_df[log_loss_df$test_mlogloss == min(log_loss_df$test_mlogloss), 1]
best_itr

## create model for prediction
pitch_xgb <- xgboost(data = train_xgb_matrix,
                     max.depth = 3,
                     nrounds = best_itr,
                     nthreads = 3,
                     params = model_parameters)

pitch_xgb

```

```{r importance}

importance <- xgb.importance(model = pitch_xgb)

xgb.ggplot.importance(importance) +
  theme_bw()

```

```{r}

## Predict probabilities
preds <- predict(pitch_xgb, newdata = test_xgb_matrix, reshape = TRUE) %>%
  data.frame() %>% 
  setNames(levels(test_cleaned$pitch_type)) %>% 
  mutate(
    across(everything(), round, 3)
  )

# Identify the highest probability
preds$pred_pitch <- factor(
  levels(test_cleaned$pitch_type)[max.col(preds, ties.method = "first")],
  levels = levels(test_cleaned$pitch_type))


# Put the original pitch types into the predicted data frame
preds$original_pitch_type <- test_cleaned$pitch_type

preds %>% head()
```

```{r evaluation}

# confusion matrix
preds %>%
  janitor::tabyl(pred_pitch, original_pitch_type)

# overall accuracy
sum(preds$pred_pitch == preds$original_pitch_type) / nrow(preds)

# within pitch type accuracy
preds %>%
  count(pred_pitch, original_pitch_type) %>%
  group_by(original_pitch_type) %>%
  summarize(N = sum(n),
            matches = sum(ifelse(pred_pitch == original_pitch_type, n, 0)),
    within_acc = matches / N)

```

## Optimizing

```{r}

cross_val_ctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                        repeats = 1,
                        number = 3,
                        classProbs = TRUE,
                        allowParallel = TRUE)

tune_grid <- expand.grid(nrounds = 1000,
                        eta = 0.01,
                        gamma = 0,
                        colsample_bytree = 1,
                        min_child_weight = 1,
                        subsample = 1,
                        max_depth = seq(2, 8, by = 2))

## This process can take a while, so lets make it faster with parallelization
if(F){
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(7)
registerDoParallel(cl)

set.seed(7)
pitch_tune <- train(x = train_cleaned %>% select(-pitch_type, -pitch_type_num),
                  y = train_cleaned$pitch_type,
                  method = "xgbTree",
                  trControl = cross_val_ctrl,
                  tuneGrid = tune_grid,
                  metric = "Accuracy",
                  verbose = TRUE)
}

saveRDS(pitch_tune,file.path(bp, "xgboost_caret.rds"))

stopCluster(cl)

pitch_tune <- readRDS(file.path(bp, "xgboost_caret.rds"))

pitch_tune
names(pitch_tune)

tune_result <- pitch_tune$results

tune_result[tune_result$Accuracy == max(tune_result$Accuracy), ]

*Possible Tuning Parameters*

* nrounds >> default = 100. Number of trees to grow.

* eta >> default = 0.3 (range = 0 to 1). Controls model learning rate by shrinking feature weights after each round until an optimum is reached. Common values are between 0.01 and 0.3.

* gamma >> default = 0 (range = 0 to Inf). Prevents overfitting by controlling regularization (penalization of large coefficients that don't improve model performance) with higher values increasing regularization.

* max_depth >> default = 6 (range = 0 to Inf). Controls tree depth (large trees = more complexity).

* min_child_weight >> default = 1 (range = 0 to Inf). Prevents overfitting by stopping tree splitting if the leaf node has a minimum sum of instance weight.

* subsample >> default = 1 (range = 0 to 1). Controls the number of observations for a tree. Common values are between 0.5 and 0.9.

* colsample_bytree >> default = 1 (range = 0 to 1). Number of features supplied to a tree. Common values are between 0.5 and 0.9.

* lambda >> default = 0. Used to avoid overfitting. Controls L2 regularization, similar to ridge regression.

* alpha >> default = 1. Controls L1 regularization, similar to Lasso.
