## TidyX Episode 11: Time Series and Bayes

Ellis and Patrick explain Eric Ekholm's (@ekholm_e) #TidyTuesday on Americas best Volleyball duo, Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor with a gorgeous column plot with rolling statistics! 

We then explore the same dataset more looking at teams winning percentages over time. Applying Bayes Theorem, we look at how we can adjust for sampling sizes of player statistics. We show that how even bayes thinks Kerri and Misty are GOATS. Finally, there is some additional code available to visualize additional teams and a shiny app.
