## Problem Statement

The FBL (fantasy baseball league) wants to predict which pitches are thrown. 
Traditionally it was labeled by a human sitting in the stands.
They want to productionalize it to give the classifications faster. 

They hired us...

## Load Data

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

bp <- here::here("TidyTuesday_Explained/058-MLB_pitch_classification_6")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      root.dir = bp)

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  suppressWarnings({
    library(tidyverse)
  })
})


```

```{r load-data-and-clean}

## see Episode 53 - bit.ly/TidyX_Ep53 - for the background on this cleanup

# train
set1 <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_21_to_2016_04_23_pitch.rds"))
set2 <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_24_to_2016_04_26_pitch.rds"))
train <- bind_rows(set1, set2)

#test
test <- readRDS(file.path(bp,"2016_04_27_to_2016_04_30_pitch.rds"))

#### Cleaning data based on EDA (below) ----------------------------------------------
train_cleaned <- train %>%
  filter(!pitch_type %in% c("KN", "IN", "PO", "EP", "FO"),
         !is.na(pitch_type)) %>%
  select(pitch_type, start_speed, end_speed, pfx_x, pfx_z, px, pz, x0, z0, vx0, vz0)

test_cleaned <- test %>%
  filter(!pitch_type %in% c("KN", "IN", "PO", "EP", "FO", "SC"),
         !is.na(pitch_type)) %>%
  select(pitch_type, start_speed, end_speed, pfx_x, pfx_z, px, pz, x0, z0, vx0, vz0)

## Check for any NA's

train_cleaned %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x)))) %>%
  t()

test_cleaned %>%
  summarize(across(.cols = everything(),
                   .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x)))) %>%
  t()


train_cleaned$pitch_type <- as.factor(train_cleaned$pitch_type)
test_cleaned$pitch_type <- as.factor(test_cleaned$pitch_type)
