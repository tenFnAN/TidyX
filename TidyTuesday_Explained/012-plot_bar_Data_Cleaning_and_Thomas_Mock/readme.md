## TidyX Episode 12: Data Cleaning and a Guest Explainer

Ellis and Patrick are joined by Thomas Mock (@thomas_mock) explain Joshua de la Bruere's (@delaBJL) #TidyTuesday submission on ingredient amounts of alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails. We take you step by step through the process of cleaning the data and make suggestions as we go! 

We then stay online and have a conversation to get to know the organizer behind #TidyTuesday. We discuss how the project started, how he started with R, and what he sees as what is next for #TidyTuesday. A must listen!
