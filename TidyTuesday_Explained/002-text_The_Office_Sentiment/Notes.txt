> Uses functions from the tidytext package. You can learn more from Julia Silge and David Robinsons’ book, Text Mining with R (https://www.tidytextmining.com/)


1) Only need to load tidyverse instead of each package separately
2) Why call out each package in front of each function?
3) Equal sign for element assignment (more of a personal preference thing)
4) Nice use of anti_join() to remove stop words
5) Nice use of printing data vis out to PDF

Key functions to explain/discuss:

> unnest_tokens() — takes single words in a string and parses them into one word (token) per row in a long data frame format
> stop_words() — removes words that are generally not useful for analysis
> get_sentiments() — used “bing” for positive and negative connotation words
