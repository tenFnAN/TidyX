# Context

- You are a penguinologist at Palmer Station 2, Antarctica LTER
- Collecting data on the penguins in the Palmer Archipelago
- One day your boss walks into your office and proclaims

# Hypothesis

# Reference Data

- [{palmerpenguins}](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) maintained by Dr. Allison Horst, Dr. Alison Hill, 
Data from Dr. Kristen Gorman

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  mutate(
    pct = n / sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  gt()
```

---

# Your data!

```{r}

suppressMessages({
penguins2 <- readr::read_csv(
  here("TidyTuesday_Explained/052-Xaringan-Presentations/palmer_penguins_3.csv"))
})

penguins2 %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  mutate(
    pct = n / sum(n)
  ) %>% 
  gt()

```

---

# Comparison

```{r, echo = FALSE}

penguins %>%
  count(species) %>%
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>%
  
  left_join(
    
    penguins2 %>%
      count(species) %>%
      mutate(pct = n / sum(n)),
    
    by = "species",
    
    suffix = c("_Palmer", "_Palmer 2")
    
  ) %>%
  
  select(species, starts_with("n"), starts_with("pct")) %>%
  
  gt(rowname_col = "species") %>%
  tab_spanner_delim(delim = "_") %>%
  fmt_percent(starts_with("pct"),
              decimals = 0)


```

Looks like Big Boss is correct!

# Classify using Random Forest!

```{r}

rf_fit <- readRDS(here("TidyTuesday_Explained/052-Xaringan-Presentations/rf_penguin_classification.rds"))

penguins2$species_preds <- predict(rf_fit, newdata = penguins2)

```

- `rf_fit` is a pretrained model
- Known to have high degree of predictive power
- we can use this rather than having the team predict the penguins species based on looks alone!

# Evaluation

Data up to date as of `r Sys.Date()`

```{r echo = FALSE}

penguins2 %>%
  
  count(species,
        species_preds) %>%
  
  pivot_wider(names_from = species_preds,
              values_from = n) %>%
  
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(species = "Original") %>%
  tab_spanner(label = "Prediction",
              columns = c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo"))
  
```
