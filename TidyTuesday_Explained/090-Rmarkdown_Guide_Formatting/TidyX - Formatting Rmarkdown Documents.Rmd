## Rmarkdown

Extends the idea of scripting (pure code) to the idea of literate programming.
This means that the output is not the side effect of the code (plots/analysis/etc), but an actual report that executes the code and puts it together with the text to form an output that is fully descriptive

## Formatting

### Text

Text is interpreted using the markdown syntax - a way to mark up your text with
styling cues, but be completely readable.
Text where there is no new line between them behaves as though they were all in-line - like a paragraph in word.

Putting an empty line between separate there into paragraphs.

We augment and stylize the text with "decorators".

Asterisks(\*) or Underlines(\_) around text make it *Italic* or _Italic with multiple words!_. 

Double Asterisks(\*) or Underlines(\_) around text make it __BOLD__ or **BOLD with Multiple Words!**. 

Double Tilde(\~) around text make it ~~strikethrough with~~. 

Up-carrots(\^) around text make it ^superscript^.

Ticks(\`) around text indicate that is `monospace`.

3 Ticks(\`) around text indicate that is area is monospace:

```
This text is all monospace
TidyX rules

```



### Headers
  
To make headers and subheaders, the new line starts with a "#". The number of "#" indicates the header level:

```
## Second level heading

#### Third level heading

##### Fifth level heading
```

### Lists

We can create unordered lists of items (bullets) using dashes:

- This would be the first bullet level
  - moving two spaces further to the right of the first level makes a sub bullet
    - this is a sub-sub bullet. There are only a few levels that will render so don't go crazy
  - back up to sub bullet level
  
We can also make ordered lists (numbered lists) using numbers:

1. This is the first numbered entry
    1. The same logic holds for sub-levels, but needs 4 spaces over
2. Another ordered list, needs multiple lines between
    - sub levels can be numbered or not
    
### Quotes

> Ellis Said Markdown is fun!
This will continue to be a quote until we have an empty line between new text

This will no longer be a quote.
  
### Links

The Markdown Cheat Sheet includes more syntax details and information: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf

Links like above are automatically set to create hyperlinks, but we can add our own links to text too!
Using [square braces for the text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket) followed by parentheses with a link, this will set the text in the square brace to a link

### Images

Including Images is similar to links, but with a minor change:
![this is the caption for the image](../../TidyX_Banner.png)

![this is the caption for the image](../../TidyX_Banner.png)

The exclamation is the syntactically different part, but the piece in the square braces is the images caption, and will displayed as such. This is optional to include. 
The part in the parentheses is the link to the image. Paths are relative to the location of the rmarkdown document, but can also be URLS.

### Code

R code to be run is denoted as three (or more) ticks, followed by a curly brace, the letter R, a closing brace.
The area for the R code is in a new line, and continues until if finds the matching set of ticks (same number as initial set). 

```{r}


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. (this is included text in the rmarkdown template from RStudio)

```{r}
print("Hi Patrick!")
```

Functionally, the R code written behaves exactly as though it was in an R script:

```{r}

plot(cars)

lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)

```

### Equations

equations are defined by dollar signs (\$) and text between is converted into a nice equation preview.

$y=a+bx+e$

$dist =  -17.579 + 3.932 * speed (+/-) 15.38$
